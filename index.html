    <p>In a search for a word with a diaeresis, such as Sint Odiliënberg, it depends whether this ë is stored as one
        character or as "&euml;". This is actually a bug that should
        be fixed -- the entities should be folded into their raw character equivalents so all searches on them are
        equivalent. See also Wikipedia:Special characters.</p>

        <li>technologists</li>
        <li>thinkers</li>
        <li>builders</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a word appears in an article with single quotes, you can only find it if you search for the word with quotes.
        Since this is rarely desirable, it is better to use double quotes in articles for which this problem does not
        arise. See the manual of style for more info.</p>

    <p>A phrase can easily be found by enclosing it in double quotes. <a href="http://www.baidu.com">Mozilla
            Manifesto</a> For example, "holly dolly" returns six matches; holly dolly (two standalone words) returns
        197.</p>
